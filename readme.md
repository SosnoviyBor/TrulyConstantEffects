# Truly Constant Effects (OpenMW)

Reconjure your summons and reapply invisibility from constant enchantment equipment automatically.

In normal Morrowind if your summon from constant enchantment dies, it doesn't respawn on its own. Same with the invisibility effect. This mod changes This mod changes it to be instant.

Here's demos of [respawning summons](https://youtu.be/snA1-ZdR0JQ) and [invisibility](https://youtu.be/vfQN6VUr7SY).

## Supported effects
- Invisibility
- All summons from Morrowind, Tribunal and Bloodmoon

## FAQ
Q: What about annoying sound and visual effects?\
A: Invisibility reapplies silently, without both sfx and vfx (unintentional, but works for me). Summons respawn as usual, with sfx and vfx.

Q: If an item has spawns multiple summons, how will it behave with the mod?\
A: The mod treats each summon separately. Each of them will respawn right after death.

Q: When reapplying invisibility, my character sometimes flashes for an instant. Is it okay?\
A: Yes. The game needs 1 frame of you being visible to know that you actually need the mod to activate.

Q: Why effects are applied for a month and not as constan effects?\
A: OpenMW limitations, which I couldn't figure out how to overcome.

Q: Does the mod work on NPCs as well?\
A: No and it's not planned.

Q: Bound equipment support?\
A: Not yet, but might add it in the future.

## Installation
Installs like any other OpenMW mod. Not sure about pre-0.49 OpenMW support, but you should use newest builds anyway.
