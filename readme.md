# Truly Constant Effects (OpenMW)

Reconjure your summons and reapply invisibility from constant enchantment equipment automaticly.

In normal Morrowind if your summon from constant enchantment dies, it doesn't respawn on its own. Same with the invisibility effect. This mod changes it, instead making it automatic with short (and configurable) delay.

Installs like any other OpenMW mod. Not sure about pre-0.49 OpenMW support, but you should use newest builds anyway.

## How it works

I'll explain it once it's done. Still have to figure it out myself.

## Shortcomings

[ TBD ]
